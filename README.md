Task 1: Read a File and Handle Exceptions
- The program reads the contents of a text file.
- If the file does not exist, it handles the FileNotFoundError.
- this is done by using try and except.
  
  Task 2:Write and Append Data to a File
 - The program asks the user to enter some text.
 - The entered text is then written into a file.
 - then new input is appended instead of overwriting.
 - and finally the file is read and displayed.
